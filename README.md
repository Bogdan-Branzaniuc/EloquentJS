## Progress
as I was studying this book by miself before working with a mentor, I did the horible mistake of not documenting my progress properly throughout the chapters and exercices. 
    A documentation of my progress will be provided, but the big minus is that nothing until chapter 16 "Project: A Platform Game" will be witnessed the fresh joy and happiness of every "AHA!" moment I have had working on it.//
## Merits
Almost all the code written was inspired, coppied from the book, with the purpose of being studied.
The small part written by the developer constitutes the exercices at the end of each chapter, however, there are places where the book's solution made more sense than what I have written. In those cases the least functional code was commented out and the most effective and cleanner code was summoned to do it's wonders.
