The fact that events can be processed only when nothing else is running
means that, if the event loop is tied up with other work, any interaction with
the page (which happens through events) will be delayed until there’s time to
process it. So if you schedule too much work, either with long-running event
handlers or with lots of short-running ones, the page will become slow and
cumbersome to use.
For cases where you really do want to do some time-consuming thing in the
background without freezing the page, browsers provide something called web
workers. A worker is a JavaScript process that runs alongside the main script,
on its own timeline.
Imagine that squaring a number is a heavy, long-running computation that
we want to perform in a separate thread. We could write a file called code/
squareworker.js that responds to messages by computing a square and sending
a message back.

addEventListener("message", event => {
postMessage(event.data * event.data);
});

To avoid the problems of having multiple threads touching the same data,
workers do not share their global scope or any other data with the main script's
environment. Instead, you have to communicate with them by sending messages back and forth.
This code spawns a worker running that script, sends it a few messages, and
outputs the responses.
let squareWorker = new Worker("code/squareworker.js");
squareWorker.addEventListener("message", event => {
console.log("The worker responded:", event.data);
});

squareWorker.postMessage(10);
squareWorker.postMessage(24);

The postMessage function sends a message, which will cause a "message"
event to fire in the receiver. The script that created the worker sends and
receives messages through the Worker object, whereas the worker talks to the
script that created it by sending and listening directly on its global scope. Only
values that can be represented as JSON can be sent as messages—the other
side will receive a copy of them, rather than the value itself.
