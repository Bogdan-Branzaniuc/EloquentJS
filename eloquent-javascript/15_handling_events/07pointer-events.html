There are currently two widely used ways to point at things on a screen: mice
(including devices that act like mice, such as touchpads and trackballs) and
touchscreens. These produce different kinds of events.


Mouse clicks
Pressing a mouse button causes a number of events to fire. The "mousedown"
and "mouseup" events are similar to "keydown" and "keyup" and fire when the
button is pressed and released. These happen on the DOM nodes that are
immediately below the mouse pointer when the event occurs.
After the "mouseup" event, a "click" event fires on the most specific node
that contained both the press and the release of the button. For example, if I
press down the mouse button on one paragraph and then move the pointer to
another paragraph and release the button, the "click" event will happen on
the element that contains both those paragraphs.
If two clicks happen close together, a "dblclick" (double-click) event also
fires, after the second click event.
To get precise information about the place where a mouse event happened,
you can look at its clientX and clientY properties, which contain the events
coordinates (in pixels) relative to the top-left corner of the window, or pageX

and pageY, which are relative to the top-left corner of the whole document
(which may be different when the window has been scrolled).
The following implements a primitive drawing program. Every time you click
the document, it adds a dot under your mouse pointer. See Chapter 19 for a
less primitive drawing program.

<style>
    canvas {
        border: 3px solid #fd3300;
    }

    body {
        height: 200px;
        background: beige;
    }

    .dot {
        height: 4px;
        width: 4px;
        border-radius: 2px;
        /* rounds corners */
        background: blue;
        position: absolute;
    }
</style>

<script>
    let clicked
    window.addEventListener("mousedown", event => {
        clicked = true
    });
    window.addEventListener("mouseup", event => {
        clicked = false
    });
    window.addEventListener("mousemove", event => {
        if (clicked == true) {
            let dot = document.createElement("div");
            dot.className = "dot";
            dot.style.left = (event.pageX - 4) + "px";
            dot.style.top = (event.pageY - 4) + "px";
            document.body.appendChild(dot);
        }
    }); 
</script>
