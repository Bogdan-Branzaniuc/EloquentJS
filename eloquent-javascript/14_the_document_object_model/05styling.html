The way an <img> tag shows an image or an <a> tag causes a link to be followedwhen it is clicked is strongly tied to
    the element type. But we can change
    the styling associated with an element, such as the text color or underline. Here
    is an example that uses the style property:

    <p><a href=".">Normal link</a></p>
    <p><a href="." style="color: green">Green link</a></p>

    A style attribute may contain one or more declarations, which are a property
    (such as color) followed by a colon and a value (such as green). When there
    is more than one declaration, they must be separated by semicolons, as in
    "color: red; border: none".



    This text is displayed <strong>inline</strong>,
    <strong style="display: block">as a block</strong>, and
    <strong style="display: none">not at all</strong>.

    The block tag will end up on its own line since block elements are not
    displayed inline with the text around them. The last tag is not displayed at
    all—display: none prevents an element from showing up on the screen. This
    is a way to hide elements. It is often preferable to removing them from the
    document entirely because it makes it easy to reveal them again later.


    JavaScript code can directly manipulate the style of an element through the
    element's style property. This property holds an object that has properties for
    all possible style properties. The values of these properties are strings, which
    we can write to in order to change a particular aspect of the element's style.
    <p id="para" style="color: purple">
        Nice text
    </p>
    <script>
        let para = document.getElementById("para");
        console.log(para.style.color);
        para.style.color = "magenta";
    </script>

    Some style property names contain hyphens, such as font-family. Because
    such property names are awkward to work with in JavaScript (you’d have to
    say style["font-family"]), the property names in the style object for such
    properties have their hyphens removed and the letters after them capitalized
    (style.fontFamily).
