We won't be using style sheets all that much in this book.Understanding them
is helpful when programming in the browser, but they are complicated enough
to warrant a separate book.
The main reason I introduced selector syntax—the notation used in style
sheets to determine which elements a set of styles apply to—is that we can use
this same mini - language as an effective way to find DOM elements.
The querySelectorAll method, which is defined both on the document object
and on element nodes, takes a selector string and returns a NodeList containing
all the elements that it matches.

    function count(selector) {
        return document.querySelectorAll(selector).length;
    }
    console.log(count("p")); // All <p> elements
    // → 4
    console.log(count(".animal")); // Class animal
    // → 2
    console.log(count("p .animal")); // Animal inside of <p>
    // → 2
    console.log(count("p > .animal")); // Direct child of <p>
// → 1
