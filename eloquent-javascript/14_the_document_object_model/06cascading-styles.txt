vThe styling system for HTML is called CSS,
for Cascading Style Sheets. A style sheet is a set of rules for how to style elements in a document. It can be given

inside a <style>
    tag. <style>strong {
        font-style: italic;
        color: gray;
    }
</style>

<p>Now <strong>strong text</strong>is italic and gray.</p>It is possible to target things other than tag names in CSS
rules. A rule for .abc applies to all elements with "abc" in their class attribute. A rule for #xyz applies to the
element with an id attribute of "xyz"(which should be unique within the document). .subtle {
color: gray;
font-size: 80%;
}

#header {
background: blue;
color: white;
}

/* p elements with id main and with classes a and b */
p#main.a.b {
margin-bottom: 20px;
}


The precedence rule favoring the most recently defined rule applies only
when the rules have the same specificity. A rule’s specificity is a measure of
how precisely it describes matching elements, determined by the number and
kind (tag, class, or ID) of element aspects it requires. For example, a rule that
targets p.a is more specific than rules that target p or just .a and would thus
take precedence over them.
The notation p > a …{} applies the given styles to all <a> tags that are direct
children of <p> tags. Similarly, p a …{} applies to all <a> tags inside <p> tags,
whether they are direct or indirect children.
