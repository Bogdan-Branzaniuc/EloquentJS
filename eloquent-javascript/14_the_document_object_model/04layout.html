The most effective way to find the precise position of an element on the
screen is the getBoundingClientRect method. It returns an object with top,
bottom, left, and right properties, indicating the pixel positions of the sides
of the element relative to the top left of the screen. If you want them relative
to the whole document, you must add the current scroll position, which you
can find in the pageXOffset and pageYOffset bindings.



A program that repeatedly alternates between reading DOM layout information and changing the DOM forces a lot of layout
computations to happen
and will consequently run very slowly. The following code is an example of
this. It contains two different programs that build up a line of X characters
2,000 pixels wide and measures the time each one takes.
<p><span id="one"></span></p>
<p><span id="two"></span></p>
<script>
    function time(name, action) {
        let start = Date.now(); // Current time in milliseconds
        action();
        console.log(name, "took", Date.now() - start, "ms");
    }
    time("naive", () => {
        let target = document.getElementById("one");
        while (target.offsetWidth < 2000) {
            target.appendChild(document.createTextNode("X"));
        }
    });
    // → naive took 32 ms
    time("clever", function () {
        let target = document.getElementById("two");
        target.appendChild(document.createTextNode("XXXXX"));
        let total = Math.ceil(2000 / (target.offsetWidth / 5));
        target.firstChild.nodeValue = "X".repeat(total);
    });
// → clever took 1 ms
</script>
